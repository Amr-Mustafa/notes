Discrete Random Variables



Despite their name, random variables are neither random nor variables. In fact, a random variable is a deterministic function. The reason for this naming stems from the fact that the value of a random variable is unknown, until the random experiment is performed. Inheriting the uncertainty from the random experiment makes a random variable random.
