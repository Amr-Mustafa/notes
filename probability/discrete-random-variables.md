Discrete Random Variables



Despite their name, random variables are neither random nor variables. In fact, a random variable is a deterministic function. The reason for this naming stems from the fact that the value of a random variable is unknown, until the random experiment is performed. Inheriting the uncertainty from the random experiment is what makes a random variable random.



Formally, a random variable $X$ is a function from the sample space $\Omega$ to the set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$. In mathematical notation, this is expressed as
$$
\begin{align*}
X \colon{} &\Omega \to \mathbb{R} \\ &\omega \mapsto x = X(\omega)
\end{align*}
$$
where $\omega \in \Omega$ and $x \in \mathbb{R}$.
